## Title:
Night of the Living Dreads (Work in Progress)

## Introduction:
After being stranded in a remote forest town, the group is forced to spend the night at an unusually packed inn. An unforeseen and ferocious storm led to the stranding of dozens of caravanners, whom the party must share the limited inn space with. As the night goes on and the party gets acquainted with the significant characters of the campaign, a slew of terrifying moans and howls begin to originate from beyond their shelter.

## Adventure Hook:
The intensity of moans quickly louden and it becomes clear that the whole inn is surrounded by hordes of undead. Coming face to face with the twisted and mangled corpses of the formerly deceased, an uncontrolled panic spreads like fire amongst the people. Patrons begin to scream and weep in total pandemonium, while the city officials rush to get everyone to settle down. Seeing our party's adventuring gear and clearly capable hands, the mayor of the town, who was at the inn as well, asks the help of the party to both tame the crowds and help the guards fend off the ravenous horde.

## The Quest: 
The players will get intertwined with the village's recent undead horde problem, and commissioned by the village elders to help them find the source and deal with it. Throughout their journey they will unravel the dark and mysterious force that compels undead to rise from the ancient catacombs below and terrorize the town. They will also put an end to the cult conspiracy that threatens livelihood of the town's residents.

## Main Objectives:

1. Defending the Town: The players will intermittently work with town members to devise defense strategies against the undead. The hordes of undead appear weekly, each time growing larger and stronger. Players must use the limited time and resources they have to create traps, defensive structures and combat strategies to counteract them.

2. Understanding the Source of The Hordes: Players must traverse treacherous catacombs to understand why this is happening. There are 7 levels to the dungeon, each being harder than the next. Clues about the civilization that used to live and use this tomb are hidden about, and the players will get to see the effects of their actions reflected in the hordes above ground. Several trips are expected as the dungeon is extensive and supplies don't last. 

3. Uncover the Conspiracy: The players will realize that some town members are actually remnants of an ancient cult that serve the Wizard King Lich below. Thus our players will have to use the clues from their dungeon clearing, and happenings in the town to uncover the identity of these people and bring them to justice. 

4. Defeat the Wizard Lich king: The players will have to put an end to the Lich's kings plans of creating a undead army and conquering the lands above, by defeating him.

## Conclusion: 
After defeating the Wizard King Lich, the effort of the players will be recognized by the local kingdom's premier adventuring guild, and they will be offered a position amongst its members. Should they accept, this will be an opportunity to create future adventures with the same characters, ultimately resulting in an organic and rich in-world history.
