## Introduction:
After watching the devastating downfall of Eltruel being engulfed by a bottomless pit and seeing chains that have swung around gripping on to the city, you rush towards it to deal with the aftermath. You approach a refugee camp filled with the many citizens of the now lost city. You see many commoners confused and stunned with what had just happened. It is now your job to deal with their grief and to figure out the next step in your mission. 
## Adventure Hook:
One of the refugee commoners, a farm hand named Vallyth, seems to be taking charge at the moment with some help from an ex-black smith named Stark. She tasks you with escorting some of the refugees to Baldur's Gate as she gathers the rest of the refugees for a mass migration.
## The Quest: 
She tasks you with escorting a group of refugees to Baldur's Gate while she stays behind to gather the remaining refugees for a larger, more organized migration. She provides you with a list of names and a rough map of the area, highlighting potential threats and safe havens along the way. 
## Main Objectives

1. **Escort the Refugees to Safety**: Determine the safest and most efficient route to Baldur's Gate. Consider potential dangers such as bandits, wild animals, and difficult terrain

2. **Figure out what to do next**: Based on the information gathered, decide on the next course of action. This could involve seeking out allies, warning other cities, or preparing for a possible follow-up attack

## Conclusion
After successfully escorting the refugees to Baldur's Gate, you reflect on the journey and the challenges faced. You look at the large gates that guard the city of Baldur's Gate, specifically you meet at the Basilisk Gate. You see a myriad of other refugees crowding around the entrance, with seemingly no one getting in...
