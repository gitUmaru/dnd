## Introduction:
Welcome to Baldur's Gate, a veritable nest of rats and vipers clinging to the rocky slopes overlooking the Chionthar River. From their high perches in the Upper City, the local nobles—known as patriars—gaze down with veiled contempt upon the common rabble in the grimy Lower City, which hugs the foggy harbor. The whole of Baldur's Gate reeks of blood, crime, and opportunity. One can easily fathom why pirates and traders are drawn to this place like flies to a carcass.
## Adventure Hook:
You talk Flame Zodge, a high ranking member of the Flaming Fits, the active in-duty mercenary army of Baldur's Gate. Basically, Zodge sizes them up, concludes they might be useful, and offers them a deal. The players agree to be deputized as members of the Flaming Fists and investigate the killings, he’ll let their refugee caravan into the city. First lead is at the Elfsong Tavern.

## The Quest: 
Investigate the recent murders that have been happening so that the Flaming Fist can focus their efforts on the refugee crisis. 

## Main Objectives

1. **Talk to Tarina**: Zodge gave you a tip that Tarina over at the Elfsong tavern might know something about the recent killings. Tarina is a frequent info merchant for the fists. Find out if she knows anything 

## Conclusion
The players talked to Tarina and found out about old tannery items found on the dead bodies. Tarina noted that the players hadn't yet looked at the bodies. Luffy almost started a bar fight with some random orc thug. Chirp (formerly Min) cut off her Hellrider tatoo. Sharif tried to rizz of priestess and didn't work out as well as he had hoped. Asharr sent a letter and tried to combat the shenangens of the party.
