### Ashara 
*"Would'ye believe me if I told you that I've sailed most of the world? Seen every kind of light you could imagine, too: The glint of the spires of Waterdeep, and the blinding white of far Icewind Dale. A moon and stars so bright, they might as well have replaced the sun- and, other times, our lanterns blazing alone, warding away the darkness of the stormy night. But in all that time, I have never needed a light-house to see my way back here. D'you know why, Zola? Because no matter how far I am from home, I can see all of you- shining threads in the dark, tethering me to my first home. I shudder to think of a day where I should lose that sight."* 

On Toril, Ashara was known in her youth as a masterful navigator and astronomer. By 1327, she was owner and captain of the *Gallant Star*, a trading ship known for the speed of its passage and its travels from the Shining Sea to Moonshae Isles, to Icewind Dale and several times past the Great Sea to Kara-Tur, and somehow even on the Sea of Fallen Stars. Her competitors would discover much later that she was a powerful adept of Chronurgy magic and a gifted Seer- secrets that would serve her well in her trade.

In the early years, this exploration was driven by both a thirst for adventure and a flight from grief; Ashara had been 15 when her and her sister's father, himself a widower, had passed- and she had stayed only as long as to honor him before stowing away on the ship that would one day become hers. 

In many ways, Ashara complemented and directly contrasted her sister; of course, she strode the world where Talma much preferred to stay in their homeland, and she was ever the freer spirit among them. In later years, a comparison was often drawn between them by members of their extended family- Ashara, despite the stern demeanor and often caustic sense of humor which would characterize her old age, was by far softer in her actions than her sister. And where Talma saw the world in grand ideals of honor and duty, Ashara saw great value in the small moments.

In the months leading up to the Sacrifice, Ashara foresaw devastation in the near future, and returned from abroad in order to warn her family. Behind closed doors, she argued with her oldest friend, begging Talma to help her lead the family to safer waters. 

As the Spellplague bore down on Halruaa and the very world rebelled against them, she lost many nights of sleep in order to understand how it could be warded off. She predicted that there was enough time to either determine a solution or to lead an exodus, and planned accordingly.

Tragically, this would be one of the few miscalculations of Ashara's life- the eve of the Sacrifice came with sudden upheaval, great rumbles and storms tearing the very land apart, and in a snap meeting the Council of Archwizards determined that the only way to survive was to leave Toril altogether; the cost of this, of course, is well known.

But Ashara, soft-hearted with a spine of steel to the end, could not accept the totality of this sacrifice. In the moments before the grand spell drew Ashara's life from her, she took hold of every thread of the family that she could, and shielded them through the tumultuous journey to Abeir as only an archwizard could have. Although they would never know, the remainders of the family in the new world would likely have perished as well, had it not been for Ashara's final act.
