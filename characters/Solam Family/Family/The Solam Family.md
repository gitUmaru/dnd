Before the Sacrifice ([[The Recent History of Halruaa]]), the Solam were a large, proud merchant-magician family. Helmed by Alma and Shara, sister archwizards, they had some notoriety amongst the Halruaan elite; others in the family were variously well-known enchanters, warders, and curse-breakers. Those who were not magically inclined often made their livelihoods in adjacent fields: jewelers, alchemists, and runewrights. Although those of magical inclination composed only perhaps a third of Halruaans before 1385, any four out of five members of the Solam family had at least a basic magical education.

However, this saturation of magic in the bloodline meant that the Solam were particularly hard-hit when Halruaa was transported onto Abeir. Many members of magical aptitude died at once, yet mysteriously an unusual number were spared, stripped of their magic but alive. By the end, there remained only nine survivors survivors- Rina and Argyst, bereaved of their daughter Azastrithe; Aldyn and Zolaetha, naval merchants and sisters who had returned to Halruaa in the tumult of the Spellplague; Avastryl and Mhaele, twins who were now orphaned, and lastly, Sarame, Turegast, and their son Ragor, who had been masterful alchemists on Toril. 

The following decades proved hard on the nation itself, and the Solam family was not spared. Although new work was plentiful as Halruaa was rebuilt, there was little safety or comfort to be found. Some sought opportunity in new places- and in so doing, some were lost. Sarame, who had become a founding member of the new defensive militia of Halruaa, died in a skirmish against the remainder of a dragon-lord's$^\dagger$ horde in 1393. Fourteen years later, Mhaele sought his fortune crossing the Ice Run, and on one such journey disappeared without a trace alongside his ship. 

But there was more to this new life than pain and darkness; Rina and Argyst welcomed Zaril in the first year after the Sacrifice, and she would come to know Avastryl and Mhaele as siblings in all but name. In the same year, Sarame's family adopted Eladyn, who too had been orphaned in the Sacrifice. In 1387 DR, the Solam family gave shelter to Ogion Evenstar, a former wizard and elf;  in return, Ogion would become a fast friend to the family in the coming century. 

Much more can be said of the years between 1405 and 1487, but after those first two decades the family grew large enough that the chronicle becomes hard to follow. Their stories are partially laid out in the family tree.

$\dagger:$ Before the Blue Breath of Change, what Abeirans call the Spellplague, much of Abeir was ruled by tyrannical dragons.
