Arasmar was born to Ashara and an unknown man before the height of her adventures on the sea; as such, he spent a good deal of his early years aboard the *Gallant Star*, often tasked with small errands, and receiving patchwork schooling from the ship's officers. His playfulness- and the amusing misadventures he often found himself in as a result- made Arasmar a favorite of his mother's old, loyal crew.  

Over the years, Ashara's magical tutelage and the bladecraft he would pick up on the *Gallant Star* would coalesce into a potent martial art. By the time he had reached adulthood, Arasmar could weave blade and magic together as naturally as he breathed.

Arasmar met Nima in 1349. The third daughter of a Zakharan tyrant, she had fled her father's oppressive household and joined Ashara's crew seeking adventure. As the only crewmembers of their age aboard the ship, they often sought each other's company, forming a close friendship which would soon become more. Arasmar imparted all of his magical knowledge to Nima- and, deprived of such an education for most of her life, she proved to be an avid student and a prodigal talent. In a short time, Nima's magic would grow to eclipse Arasmar's, lending her fearsome control over the sea and storm.

Soon after, they would split from Ashara's crew to find their own fortunes and. In the next half decade, they would gain significant renown as bounty hunters in the seas of Kara-Tur. Arasmar's bladesong, carried on the powerful winds of the Celestial Sea, could send a shiver down the spine of the hardiest pirate; and if a thunderclap was heard in broad daylight, it was a sign to flee from Nima's oncoming storm.

Eventually, with their son Rethym's arrival, the pair would retire from their bounty hunting. Settling back in Halruaa, they turned their attention to supporting the extended family's merchant enterprise, which had grown into a substantial force by this time, and to teaching the arts of blade and magic to those who might not otherwise have learned them. Soon after their return, their daughter Ilyena would be born.

So they would live for the next two decades, happy in their lot. Despite the turmoil that characterized that period across Toril, they were able to raise their children well and live prosperously for a time. But, by the Year of Blue Fire, they too were were drawn into the madness. They helped extensively to prepare the mythals and webs that would shield Halruaa in the destruction to come; and when it arrived, they too would make the Sacrifice for the hope of salvation.
