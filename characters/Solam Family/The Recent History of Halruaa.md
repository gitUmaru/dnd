A little over a century ago, Halruaa was a land of magic in the south of Faerûn. Worshippers of Mystra and Azuth, near a third of their people had some measure of ability in magic, and as a consequence it was home to many wizards of high art. In the wake of the Spellplague, however, it was thought to have been destroyed.

The truth, however, was more complex: possessed of magical foresight, the archwizards of Halruaa initiated a great Sacrifice to save their nation. In doing so, they had transported the country across the Realmspace to Abeir. It had cost them dearly- by the end of that cataclysm, perhaps only one in five people with arcane ability survived; near every Halruaan had lost kin, and now they found themselves in a hostile world.  

In time, grief coalesced into fear: on Abeir, where magic was scarce, many forswore it altogether. In time, however, they also rebuilt; an educated, careful people, they set about the task of surviving in this hostile world immediately. And, in time, they found allies- although wizardry was lost to them, their artifacts worked yet, and through sending stones they were able to speak with the Lantanna, another people of Toril who had suffered a similar fate. Once separated by the desert and sea, the drifting remnants of these nations formed a strong friendship against the ravages of the new world.

In 1487 DR, however, fate once again altered its course; on the tail end of the Second Sundering, Halruaa and Lantan were transported back onto Toril; while the Lantanna, as an island people, were mostly isolated from the tumult of Faerûn, the Halruaa had old and new enemies to contend with; but, although magic had long been lost to them, many old wizards yet remained to take up the mantle once more...
