### Backstory
---
Born eighty-six years after the Great Sacrifice, Ashar knew of Toril only through stories from the old. Amongst them, recollections of lost glory ran strong; but, not possessing a sorcerer's innate magic, he knew of wizardry only through rare artefacts. In any child, being born too late to have learned magic would have induced envy- but in Ashar, it brought on a slow longing that would last for over a decade.

Ashar's childhood was, for the most part, peaceful and unremarkable. The Halruaa tradition of schooling had served him well, and he had quickly distinguished himself; upon completing his schooling, he became an apprentice to Ogion, an elven former wizard and an old friend of the Solam family. By 1484 DR, he served as scholar-ambassador to the Lantanna. Between 1484 and 1487, Ashar and Ogion undertook several journeys to Lantan, and this served as Ashar's tutelage toward the goal of one day filling Ogion's role.

In this time, Ashar often urged Ogion to teach him the old ways of magic, if only as an intellectual pursuit- but, to Ogion, this task was as difficult as teaching his ward to swim in the middle of a desert. And, secretly, Ashar despaired at the futility of learning the mystic arts- after all, he might never be able to apply them.

Perhaps fortunately, this was not meant to be; even as Ashar grew out of boyhood, the Second Sundering had begun throughout the Realmspace; in 1487, while Ogion and his student were stationed at the Halruaan embassy in Lantan, both nations were unceremoniously transposed back to Toril. Lantan was spared much of the upheaval characteristic of that time; isolated as they had been before the Spellplague, they had only to contend with pirates and the odd raid.

In the ensuing months, once the chaos in Halruaa had died down, new orders came to them- Halruaa was deploying envoys throughout Faerûn and Kara-tur, and Ogion was well-placed for a swift journey to the mainland Sword Coast.

Ogion was meant to be stationed in Baldur's Gate; but Ashar was now able to learn magic, and Ogion himself was woefully out of practice. Candlekeep, the old bastion of knowledge, was not so far from his Station, and so a new arrangement was made. Ashar would act as Ogion's representative amongst the Avowed of Candlekeep, and in the meantime would study magic under Skoda, the First Reader.

From early 1488 until now, Ashar acted in this capacity. Recently, Aloh, a wizard of Waterdeep, had been studying an artefact of seeming Halruaan origin, and had asked for help with its study. The envoy to Waterdeep was no wizard himself, and so sent for Ogion. The old elf, in turn, asked Ashar to retrieve the artefact for him, and so for the first time in four years Ashar prepared for a new journey. He was to escort Aloh's agent, who had been waylaid in the Trollclaws and was recovering in Elturel, over to Baldur's Gate, from whence they would travel north along the Sword Coast.

The first leg of the journey had been a short ship's voyage along the Chionthar to Elturel, and Ashar had just completed it. Stepping off the _Silver Duchess_ onto the riverside harbor, he soon set off into the city proper...
