## Backstory

The aristocratic Solam family once held considerable wealth and power in imperial Corantel, but this was lost over a century past to poor choices in loyalty during a civil war. The scions of the bloodline today seek either to regain the lost glory of their house, or to leave its shadow far behind them. Ashar was one of the later kind. Half-elves are looked upon poorly in their homeland, and bastard children of dead sons more dimly sƟll; as such, they lived a life of strictures and control, and they were not missed when they stole away in the dead of the night on the cusp of adulthood. The elven love of far horizons had sung in Ashar’s blood for as long as they could remember, and there was a wide world to see beyond the walls of the Solam estate. But life on the road is often harder than life at home; freedom, as Ashar soon learned, was paid for with hardship. Little kindness could be found for one of their kind, particularly in the backwater villages they travelled through. Hunger was a new companion, but not one that was eager to leave. That first year abroad nearly killed Ashar, and it taught them hard lessons about trust and faith in the good will of others. Nonetheless, in time they found themselves in Neiah, a grand port city. Employment was easier to find here- it is difficult to maintain prejudice when half the world’s people are your neighbors, and the other half visit from distant lands. Ashar’s quick wit earned them an apprenticeship with Ogion, a retired battlemage, and for a few peaceful years they studied magic, folklore, and the motion of the stars. Eventually, however, wanderlust struck them again- to see ships disappear across the sea and never follow was unconscionable. Scraping up their modest savings and promising Ogion that they would meet each other again, Ashar took the navigator’s post aboard the Silver Duchess, a trader’s galley. It was bound for Cifar, a land they had heard of only in stories and ancient accounts and so were eager to travel to. Three weeks of calm winds bore them across the sea; the sailors grumbled of an unnatural calm, but Ashar paid them little heed. In hindsight, Ashar wonders if they ought to have been as worried: soon after making landfall, they joined a caravan across the Cifarran desert. The still nights at sea were replaced with raging storm not two days into the desert, and Ashar was separated from their companions. Seeking refuge from the severe winds, they happened upon a small oasis…
