Spark notes version that I'll fill in later because I REALLY don't want to rewrite everything right now

- Nominally training to be an ambassador himself, but really working on learning some Lantanna artificing
- Artificers are largely boring squares, Ashar's tutor (Belorin) is a prime example
- Close friends with Doric, a journeyman who took to Ashar like a younger sibling
- Bitterly at odds with Avilda, for no particular reason other than that they were neck-and-neck academic rivals and were both too young to understand that professional rivalry doesn't need to bleed into personal hostility
- Was in Lantan during the Second Sundering, worried about whether family was safe and if Halruaa even returned to Toril (for a couple months until he got a message)
- Helped rebuild in Lantan while awaiting orders from Halruaa, which took most of a year since Halruaa was in even more dire straits (AGAIN)
