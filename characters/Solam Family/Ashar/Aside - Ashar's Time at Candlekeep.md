Sparknotes version, I lost a ton of progress to a crash and it's a bit late at night to be rewriting everything/

- Came to Candlekeep to study magic under the first reader, Skoda
- turns out Avilda, who had distinguished herself among the artificers, had also received special dispensation to study with the avowed
	- gaddamit.png
	- immediately go back to world class hating, think Holt and Wuntch but annoying teenagers and without the sexual undertone
- Skoda originally had one apprentice, a sorc named Casnar, who fuckin HATES Ashar and Avilda for stealing his spotlight and because he thinks they're dim for not understanding magic while almost being adults
	- Spends a ton of time antagonizing and sabotaging them both for most of 1488
- Eventually Ashar and Avilda call a truce to deal with Casnar, also partially catalyzed by a massive haranguing from Skoda when one of their "academic disagreements" burned a hole through the laboratory roof
	- the story of Casnar's comeuppance remains to be written 
	- They remain friends thereafter, but won't admit it for a while because of rivalry "tradition" (it's been like 4 years stfu)
	- Eventually move past it when they finish basic tutelage and move on to independent study, late 1489
	- "They did not admit as much for some time, but on still nights one could often hear the cavalier laughter of two drunk, teenaged wizards echo across the roofs of the castle, mocking several members of the faculty and the world at large. Skoda, for his part, ignored it in a valiant show of good humor and indulgence."
- Technically both Ashar and Avilda are still studying at Candlekeep, but Ashar is on a mission to Elturel for Ogion (we know how that's going), and Avilda found an interesting lead in Neverwinter
